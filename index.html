                Hey! My name’s Angus, I’m based in Bristol in the United Kingdom and I’m looking forward to starting a Software Engineering course with Flatiron School.

Applying to Flatiron School might be the second big leap of faith in my life.

The first one was starting an arts company in London and building it from the ground up. The experience of taking anything from zero to one is an amazing experience and moving the company from one-off shows in churches, to artistic residents of the Busey Building in Peckham is something I’ll always be proud of.

If you’d have told me a couple of years ago that I’d be applying to train as a Software Engineer, I wouldn’t have believed you! When the pandemic hit though, I began to spend less of my time working for myself in a field that I loved and more of it work just to exist. 

Over time, I began to crave a career that would present me new challenges everyday and give me the opportunity to show my true potential with complex work. I somehow began to do the odd web-design module on free-code camp and slowly but surely found my way to Flatiron School.

Writing this now as part of my prework is an amazing feeling and I can’t wait to interact with some amazing people and grow from the challenges the course ahead. </p>
