                <p> 
                    Hey! My name’s Angus, I’m based in Bristol in the United Kingdom and I’m looking forward to starting a Software Engineering course with Flatiron School.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    My career and training to this point hasn’t been technical at all- if you’d have told me a couple of years ago that I’d be applying to train as a software engineer, there’d be no way that I’d have believed you! That being said, I can’t wait for the series of challenges this training can offer me, as well as the opportunity to show my true potential in the handling of complex work. 

                </p>
                    
                <p> I can't wait to begin a brand new adventure and interact with some amazing people along the way!
                </p>
