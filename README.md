# My Personal Website

- This image was structured in HTML and styled with CSS. The animations and mouseover effects were acheived through CSS and JavaScript.

- The image slider was achieved with this how-to from w3 schools: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp

- The aubergine recipe is not my own, but has passed between so many friends that I don't know who the author is!

- One unresolved issue with my final project is that I cannot get the links of the 'biography' section to register. My Live Support helper and I figured out that issue was with the sliding-container swallowing up the biography container (whenever I double click on the links, the images become highlighted). I've tried experimenting with position and z-index, but can't figure out how to make them come to the fore. Any ideas are much appreciated!
